```{r}

rm(list = ls()) # Clean your environment:
gc() # garbage collection - It can be useful to call gc after a large object has been removed, as this may prompt R to return memory to the operating system.
library(pacman)
p_load(tidyverse, rmsfuns)

# Source in all your functions:
list.files('code/', full.names = T, recursive = T) %>% as.list() %>% walk(~source(.))

Result <- example_function(x = 10, y = 20)
