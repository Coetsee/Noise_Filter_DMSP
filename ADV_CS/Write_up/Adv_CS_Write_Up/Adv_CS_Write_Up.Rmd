# Introduction \label{Introduction}

The use of remote sensing data, and more specifically, satellite nighttime light data, presents potential
for new and diverse applications in socioeconomic research. Nightlight data remains a largely objective 
measure, and is thereby suitable to use as a proxy in a broad array of studies that require the usage of 
potentially unreliable or otherwise lacking data. This advantage is especially pertinent in parts of the 
developing world, where socioeconomic research can prove most beneficial. There exists different night 
lights products which can be utilized towards this end, the most common of which is the 'Stable Lights' 
product, derived from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's (DMSPs) Operational Linescan System 
(OLS). This paper emphasises the usage of this product specifically focusing on its shortcomings. Most 
prominently, DMSP-OLS has difficulty in separating background noise from night lights generated from 
human-generated light, especially in areas that display lower levels of night light intensity. This 
presents an obvious problem: analyses that attempt to use Stable Lights as a proxy for economic activity,
for instance, would exaggerate or understate economic activity in these low-luminous areas. 

This paper attempts to address the challenge of inaccurate measurement of night lights by applying a 
filtering technique to identify and separate nightlights emitted by humans from those emitted by anything
else. This filtering process is based on the methodology for deriving the 'Local Human Lights' product by
@maatta, and relies on a Random Forest (RF) Machine Learning algorithm for classification. 


# Explication of the Problem

## Stable Lights and Economic Activity

The most prominent difficulty, however, relates to the amount of noise in the lower end of the light
distribution due in part to the blooming effect mentioned above. Standard practice using the stable 
lights data set is to discard these values from analysis, thereby removing a large proportion of cell
observations.

## Problems with Stable Lights





# Method and Data \label{Methodology}

The filtering process used by @maatta necessitates the following steps:

---------------------
5. Local Human Lights Process
Our second product shifts weight from minimizing regional bias to maximizing the accuracy in
human-generated light detection. We utilize the regional light characteristics in the filtering process in
two ways. First, we include more regional variables as inputs in the random forest algorithm. Second,
we divide the world into sub-regions and run the algorithm separately for each region. This allows
the algorithm to learn how the light characteristics relate to built-up areas in different sub-regions.
Remote Sens. 2019, 11, 2194 11 of 21
Since that relationship most likely differs across the world, we achieve a better prediction accuracy by
allowing for variations in the classification rule.
In practice, we crop the variable images into 2000 Ã— 2000 pixel sub-regions after the data preparation
phase (Step 1). Accordingly, the size of a sub-region is approximately 3.4 million km2 at the equator,
which is close to the size of India. The number of rows in a sub-region is 4 million, and we take a
subsample of 10% for the model training. By running different versions, we found this window size to
have a good balance between improvements in prediction accuracy and being widely independent of
the quality of the built-up data. However, the changes in the classification rule across the sub-regions
causes a problem at their borders. The shifts in predicted probabilities, and consequently the number
of lit pixels, are visibly clear.
The solution for smoothing the border effects is to move the sub-region window in smaller steps
and then average the results. The step size should be as small as possible, but we rapidly run into
computational constraints. Therefore, we decide to move the window in steps of 250 pixels so that we
receive 64 values for each pixel. Unlike in the global approach, we now set the number of lit pixels
within each window by using a 4% tolerance level. This means that we keep classifying light in pixels
as human-generated in the order of highest probability until 4% of avg_light pixels with values below 5
are included. By setting the amount of light with this tolerance threshold, we avoid having to make
subjective choices of light amounts across regions or base them on the built-up data. However, we have
to include a backstop or we end up adding lit pixels also in areas where there is no human-generated
light at all. Therefore, we additionally set all pixels with a predicted probability less than 20% of being
human-generated to zero.
As described above, we classify light in each pixel 64 times by the overlapping sub-region windows
as human-generated or not. After Step 3 in the filtering process, we mosaic all the windows and
count the classifications. We then create the final product in Step 4 by taking the light value from the
average visible band image if a pixel is classified as human-generated more than eight times out of
64. Otherwise, we set the light value in a pixel to zero. The requirement of eight human-generated
light classifications makes a final global adjustment to the amount of light. We have chosen the light
amount settings in a way that balances the improvement in detecting human-generated light while
keeping misclassifications at a low level. Howeve

## Data 

Although our methodology largely follows that presented by @maatta, there are some distinct differences.

- Size of area
- Jitter size 
- Probability of human-generated

# Results \label{Results}


# Discussion \label{Conclusion}

This paper explicated on the usage of a filtering methodology proposed by @maatta with which to separate 
background noise from human-generated nightlight data. 

Our results echo those by @maatta: the RF algorithm introduces great improvements in classification 
accuracy and thus greater accuracy in filtering out background noise from the  'Stable Lights' product. 
This allows the researcher to do away with the need for quick-and-easy type fixes to noisy data at the
lower end of the luminosity distribution. 

However, it is important to note what this method does not achieve. For instance, the 'Human Lights' 
product does not address the issue of blooming or oversaturation at the high end of the luminosity 
spectrum. Likewise, its spatial resolution remains low in comparison to more modern products such as the 
Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and it is recommended to use these products rather
than the DMSP-OLS 'Stable Lights' or 'Human Lights' products if possible.
